DefCon 22 LaserTag
=============

Attendees to the yearly DefCon computer security conference are encouraged to hacking and/or modify the badges handed out for entrance. 
 
This is a modified program to turn your badge into a Laser Tag playing machine! 
 
Features: 
- Eight leds illuminate representing each players health total 
- Pressing the "DEFCON" touch pads fires an infrared single out of the badge 
- If a badge receives an infrared single from a badge other their own a life point is removed 
- Once a player life total is below 8 the leds display a blow-up animation 
- Badges regenerate 1 life point per 2 seconds
